# Notes-App
This is a simple sticky notes app. It allows the user to write the title and content of their notes in the input fields and press the add button in order to create the note. Each note is saved in local storage and is then displayed on the screen. In order to clear a note the user can press the delete button. I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS in this project.
